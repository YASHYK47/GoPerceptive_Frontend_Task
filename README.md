The task will be stored in the redux-store and you will be directed back to the Index page.
  You can click on any of the event to view it and you will then be redirected to the view-event page where all the details of the event are present and you can delete this event from the red-button(Delete) provided or you can click on green-button(Back) to get back to the index page.
